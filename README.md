=======
A Unity 5.1 re-creation of the Woodman stage from Megaman 2.

Note
----
* My goal with this project was to create a decent Megaman 2 style stage in the shortest amount of time possible. It is not an exact replica but it captures the essence well enough.
* A primary goal was to complete the project at break-kneck speed. Therefore, the code is relativley smelly.
* I chose the Woodman stage simply because I like the music the most out of all available stages.
* I have included **only** the source code for this project as the characters, music, and artwork belong to Capcom.

TODO
----
* Show the game in action.
